The N1-A through N1-E Zoning Districts allow for the development of single -family, duplex, and triplex dwellings on all lots. Additionally, quadraplex dwellings are allowed on arterial streets in these zoning districts when an affordable housing unit is provided within the dwelling. The N1-F Zoning District allows all dwelling types allowed in N1-A through N1-E Zoning Districts, as well as small-scale multi-family dwellings, and is intended for application typically on arterial streets within Neighborhood 1 Place Type.Specific standards within each of the zoning districts address building form and promote context-sensitive, compatible neighborhood development. The Neighborhood 1 Zoning Districts also allow for select nonresidential uses, such as places of worship and educational facilities, and for the reuse of existing neighborhood commercial establishments under prescribed conditions.\nN1-A Neighborhood 1 Zoning DistrictThe N1-A Zoning District allows for the development of residential dwellings on lots of 10,000 square feet or greater.The N1-A Zoning District is typically applied to established neighborhoods.\nN1-B Neighborhood 1 Zoning DistrictThe N1-B Zoning District allows for the development of residential dwellings on lots of 8,000 square feet or greater.The N1-B Zoning District is typically applied to established neighborhoods.\nN1-C Neighborhood 1 Zoning DistrictThe N1-C Zoning District allows for the development of residential dwellings on lots of 6,000 square feet or greater.The N1-C Zoning District is typically applied to established neighborhoods.\nN1-D Neighborhood 1 Zoning DistrictThe N1-D Zoning District allows for the development of residential dwellings on lots of 3,500 square feet or greater.\nN1-E Neighborhood 1 Zoning DistrictThe N1-E Zoning District allows for the development of residential dwellings on lots of 3,000 square feet or greater.\nN1-F Neighborhood 1 Zoning DistrictThe N1-F Zoning District allows for the development of residential dwellings on lots of 3,000 square feet or greater and is intended to be applied predominantly along arterials.\n", "metadataJson": "{\"section_url\": \"/articles/article-4-neighborhood-1-zoning-districts/#41-purpose\"}"}, {"title": "4.2 USES", "text": "Article 15 lists permitted, temporary, and accessory uses for the Neighborhood 1 Zoning Districts.

Abbreviation included shall be interpreted as follows: MF = Multi-Family. (Additional abbreviations are described in Section 2.2.)\nWhere this Ordinance refers to frontages in general, a transit station, off-street public path, or public park shall not be considered a frontage within the Neighborhood 1 Zoning Districts.\nIn the tables below, where a cell contains a standard or a \u201c.\u201d the standard shall be applicable. Where a cell is blank and shaded, the standard shall not apply.\n\n\nLotLot standards govern the basic dimensions of lots, including but not limited to minimum area, width, and coverage as applicable. These standards are intended to provide a rational basis for the division, organization, and development of land within the City of Charlotte.\nTable 4-1: Neighborhood 1 Zoning Districts Lot Standards\nBuilding SitingBuilding siting standards govern the placement of buildings on lots and are intended to ensure that development maintains compatibility with its surrounding context and the intent of the applicable zoning district.\nTable 4-2: Neighborhood 1 Zoning Districts Building Siting Standards\n1 Front setbacks shown on a plat recorded at the Register of Deeds shall supersede required zoning district front setbacks.\n2 The following alternative setback standards may be used for an established blockface that is at least 25% developed or has at least four existing dwellings:\n\nA single-family, duplex, or triplex dwelling in an established blockface may be located no closer to the street than the two closest residential buildings on the same blockface.\nIn no case shall the minimum setback be less than ten feet or intrude into a required clear sight triangle at an intersection (Section 16.1).\n\n3 In the case of a lot abutting both a local or collector street and a parallel arterial street (through lot), buildings shall orient toward the local or collector street.\n4 In no case shall any building entry be located closer than six feet to an existing or proposed off-street public path or shared use path.\n5 When the corner side setback is located along an arterial street, the corner side setback shall be subject to the minimum front setback dimension for the zoning\u00a0district.\n6 Street includes public and network-required private streets. For network-required private streets, front setback is measured from the back of curb, and shall be as\u00a0indicated for the zoning district, plus an additional 14 feet.\n\nBuilding HeightBuilding height standards govern the maximum heights of buildings, as applicable, and are intended to provide flexibility while maintaining appropriate transitions to adjacent areas.\n1\u00a0The height and location of structures may be restricted by the limitations set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14 Part 77: Safe, Efficient Use, and Preservation of the Navigable Airspace. A notice of proposed construction FAA Form 7460-1 must be filed with the FAA for construction or alteration that impacts any of the imaginary surfaces as defined in 14 CFR Part 77 or is more than 200 feet in height above the ground at its site at least 45 days prior to construction. The Aviation Department Planning Division may serve as a point of contact for information regarding building notification requirements and obstruction evaluation.\u200d2\u00a0Building height may be increased by one foot for each additional one foot of building setback from required side and rear setbacks to a maximum height of 65 feet. The maximum building height of any structure within 200 feet of residential uses or vacant land in a Neighborhood 1 Place Type is limited as follows: That portion of a structure within the first 100 feet is limited to a maximum of 50 feet in height, and each portion of the building may be measured independently, from the average grade of the portion being measured to the highest point of the same portion.\u200d\n\n\nBuilding Height Setback Plane for Duplexes and TriplexesIn addition to the maximum building height requirement, all duplex and triplex buildings within the Neighborhood 1 Zoning Districts shall meet the building height setback plane regulations below.\n\nAll duplex and triplex buildings are limited to a sidewall height at the required minimum side setback of 20 feet or the average height of the residential building sidewalls on both sides of the lot, whichever is greater. Sidewalls shall be measured from the finished floor elevation of the main floor to the eave or, if no eave is present on the residential building, to the bottom of the finished roof plane. For a corner lot, the closest residential building on the same blockface and the residential building closest to such are used for averaging. If a sidewall height of greater than 20 feet is proposed, a height survey of the closest residential building sidewalls is required at the time of permitting.\nIf no residential buildings exist on the same blockface as a new residential building under development, the maximum building height for the zoning district controls.\nAdditional building height is granted at a ratio of one foot of additional side setback to one foot of height, establishing a building height setback plane at 45 degrees. Buildings may not exceed the maximum building heights of the zoning district.\nDormers and gable ends may extend into and through the 45 degree building height setback plane but shall comply with the maximum building height.\n\n\n\n\nBUILDING HEIGHT SETBACK PLANE (DUPLEX AND TRIPLEX)\u200d\nBuilding ArticulationBuilding articulation standards govern the dimensions of building facade elements and entry features and are intended to facilitate the enhancement of a pedestrian-oriented environment. The following standards apply only to building fa\u00e7ades facing a frontage, except for Limited Access. The standards below apply to all uses unless a use has a specific standard.
