Floodplain Regulations", "metadataJson": "{\"base_url\": \"article-27-floodplain-regulations\"}", "section": [{"title": "27.1 INTRODUCTION, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES", "text": "\n\u201d Statutory AuthorizationThe Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Articles 7, 9, and 11 of Chapter 160D; Article 6 of Chapter 153A; and Article 8 of Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes (N.C.G.S.), delegated to local governmental units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.\n*B.* Purpose\n\nThe flood hazard areas of Charlotte and Charlotte\u2019s extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) are periodically inundated by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains. This not only results in increases in flood heights and velocities during flooding events but the loss of life, increased health and safety hazards, destruction of public and private property, and disruption of commerce and governmental services. This article promotes public health, safety, and general welfare and minimizes public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by regulations designed to:\n\nRestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, welfare, and property due to water or erosion hazards and encourage the retention of open land uses located and designed to constitute a harmonious and appropriate part of the physical development of the City as provided in the Comprehensive Plan and subsequent area planning efforts.\n\n\n\nRequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, both public and private, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.\n\n\n\nControl the alteration of, and encroachment upon, natural floodplains, stream channels, natural protective barriers, and drainage courses which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters, thus limiting the expenditure of public money for flood-control projects.\n\n\n\nControl filling, grading, dredging, and other development activities which may increase erosion or flood damage.\n\n\n\nPrevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which shall unnaturally divert flood waters, or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\n\n\n\nEnsure uses permitted to be located within flood hazard areas are designed in a manner such that they do not impede the flow of flood waters or otherwise cause danger to life and/or property and to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding.\n\n\n\nSupport sound development practice and a stable tax base by providing for accurate mapping of community flood fringe areas on the flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) and notice for existing and potential property owners of special flood hazard areas, associated flood risks and development restrictions.\n\n\n\nTo minimize future flood losses by depicting future flood fringe areas on the FIRM.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is the intent that the regulations in this article are used in conjunction with the zoning district regulations for subject properties. Any use not permitted by the zoning district shall not be permitted in the special flood hazard area, and any use permitted by the zoning district shall be permitted only upon meeting conditions and requirements as prescribed in this article.\n\n\n", "metadataJson": "{\"section_url\": \"/articles/article-27-floodplain-regulations/#271-introduction,-purpose,-and-objectives\"}"}, {"title": "27.2 APPLICABILITY", "text": "\n\u201d General ApplicabilityThis article shall apply to property within the City and the extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) and also within the area shown on the FIRM or any Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and/or locally approved revisions to data shown on the FIRM, that is located within the community special flood hazard areas or land adjacent to the community special flood hazard areas if affected by work taking place.\n*B.* Basis for Establishing the Special Flood Hazard Areas\n\nAll streams in Mecklenburg County with drainage areas of one square mile or greater have established community and FEMA base flood elevations and community encroachment areas and FEMA floodways.\n\n\n\nThe FEMA and community special flood hazard areas are those identified in the effective flood insurance study (FIS) for Mecklenburg County and the City of Charlotte, dated November 16, 2018, and its accompanying FIRM, and all local or FEMA-approved revisions to the FIRM and/or FIS.\n\n\n\nIn areas where a preliminary FIRM and preliminary FIS exist, community base flood elevations shown on the preliminary FIRM and preliminary FIS shall be used for local regulatory purposes, if they are higher than those shown on the effective FIRM and FIS.\n\n\n\nThe initial FIRM are as follows for the jurisdictional areas at the initial date:\n\nCity of Charlotte dated August 15, 1978.\n\n\n\nMecklenburg County Unincorporated Area, dated June 1, 1981.\n\n\n\n\n*C.* Floodplain Development Permit RequiredA floodplain development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this article prior to the commencement of any development activities.
