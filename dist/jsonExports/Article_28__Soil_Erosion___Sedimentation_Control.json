General Requirements\nErosion and Sedimentation Control MeasuresAll land-disturbing activities, including those that disturb less than an acre, shall provide adequate erosion control measures, structures, or devices in accordance with this article sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of the tract.\nPlan RequiredNo person shall initiate, direct, allow, or conduct any land-disturbing activity on a tract that meets any of the following criteria without having a copy of an erosion and sedimentation control plan (hereinafter referred to as \u201cplan\u201d) on the job site approved by the City:\n\nUncovers one acre or more. In determining the size of the disturbed area, lands being developed as a unit shall be aggregated regardless of ownership.\nIn borrow and waste areas covered by item D.6 below, with a disturbed area one acre or greater.\n\n\nCompliancePlans submitted to the Stormwater Administrator shall comply with this section and Section 28.4 of this article.\nProtection of PropertyPersons conducting land-disturbing activity shall take all reasonable measures to protect all public and private property from damage caused by such activity and associated sedimentation.\nConflicts; Applicability of More Restrictive RulesWhenever conflicts exist between the regulations in this article and federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, or rules, the more restrictive provision shall apply.\nB. Basic Control ObjectivesA plan shall include adequate erosion control measures, structures, or devices to address the following control objectives:\nIdentify Critical AreasOn-site areas that are subject to severe erosion and off-site areas that are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/or sedimentation are to be identified and receive special attention.\nLimit Time of ExposureAll land-disturbing activity shall be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time.\nLimit Exposed AreasAll land-disturbing activity shall be planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time.\nControl Surface WaterSurface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period of exposure.\nControl SedimentationAll land-disturbing activity shall be planned and conducted to prevent sedimentation damage.\nManage Stormwater RunoffWhen the increase in the velocity of stormwater runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to cause accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, plans are to include measures to control the velocity at the discharge point so as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site and to decrease sedimentation to any lake or watercourse.\nC. Mandatory Standards for Land-Disturbing ActivityNo land-disturbing activity subject to the control of this article shall be undertaken except in accordance with the following:\nLake, Watercourse and Wetland ProtectionAdditional erosion control measures, structures, or devices as specified in the City and Mecklenburg County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Policies and Procedures statement issued by the Stormwater Administrator shall be required to provide a higher level of protection to lakes, watercourses, and wetlands from sedimentation.\nGraded Slopes and FillsThe angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no greater than the angle which can be retained by vegetative cover or other adequate erosion control measures, structures, or devices. In any event, slopes left exposed shall, within 21 calendar days of completion of any phase of grading, be planted or otherwise provided with temporary or permanent groundcover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be demonstrated to be stable. Stable is the condition where the soil remains in its original configuration, with or without mechanical constraints.\nFill MaterialMaterials being used as fill shall be consistent with those described in the North Carolina Administrative Code (NCAC) per 15A NCAC 13B .0562 unless the site is permitted by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (hereinafter referred to as NCDEQ) Division of Waste Management to operate as a landfill. Not all materials described in 15A NCAC 13B .0562 may be suitable to meet geotechnical considerations of the fill activity and should be evaluated accordingly.\nGroundcoverWhenever land-disturbing activity is undertaken on a tract, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install erosion and sedimentation control devices and practices that are sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of said tract, and shall plant or otherwise provide a permanent groundcover sufficient to restrain erosion after completion of construction or development. Provisions for a permanent groundcover sufficient to restrain erosion shall be accomplished within 21 calendar days following completion of construction or development. For an area of a site that is inactive for a period of 21 calendar days or longer, temporary groundcover shall be required\nPrior Plan ApprovalNo person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity on a tract if one acre or more is to be disturbed unless a plan for that activity has been submitted and approved in accordance with Section 28.4.\nPre-Construction ConferenceIf one acre or more is to be uncovered, the person conducting land-disturbing activity, or an agent of that person shall contact the Stormwater Administrator at least 48 hours before commencement of the land-disturbing activity. The purpose is to arrange an on-site meeting with the Stormwater Administrator to review and discuss the approved plan and the proposed land-disturbing activity.\nMonitoringThe landowner, financially responsible party, person conducting land-disturbing activity, or an agent of those persons, shall inspect all erosion and sedimentation control measures at least once a week and within 24 hours after any storm event of greater than one inch of rain per 24 hour period, or more frequently if required by federal or state law. The person performing this monitoring shall have certification or commensurate training and experience approved by the Stormwater Administrator.\n\nIf one acre or more is to be disturbed, a record of inspections shall be kept by the person conducting the land-disturbing activity, or an agent of that person, until six months after construction is completed and grading permit termination is approved by the Stormwater Administrator. The record shall include all monitoring and inspection elements as required by the North Carolina General Permit, NCG01 (NCG01). Additional record keeping may be required by federal or state law and as stated on the approved plans.\nCorrective action for repairs and maintenance indicated on the record shall be initiated within 24 hours after a rain event or within 24 hours of the last inspection if a rain event did not prompt the inspection, unless additional time is allowed by the Stormwater Administrator. The date of the completion of such repairs shall be noted. The records of inspection shall be made available to the Stormwater Administrator upon request.\nPersons who have had a notice of violation or repeated warning about off-site sedimentation or nonmaintenance of adequate erosion control measures, structures, or devices may be required to provide the Stormwater Administrator with a self-inspection record for the particular tract.\n\n\nSedimentation Control BufferNo land-disturbing activity during periods of construction or improvement to land shall be permitted in proximity to a lake or watercourse unless a sedimentation control buffer zone is provided along the margin of the watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within the 25% of the sedimentation control buffer zone nearest the land-disturbing activity.\n\nProjects On, Over, or Under WaterThis sedimentation control buffer requirement shall not apply to a land-disturbing activity in connection with the construction of facilities to be located on, over, or under a lake or watercourse.\nSedimentation Control Buffer MeasurementUnless otherwise provided, the width of a sedimentation control buffer zone is measured horizontally from the edge of the water to the nearest edge of the disturbed area, with the 25% of the strip nearer the landdisturbing activity containing natural or artificial means of confining visible siltation.\n\n\nAdherence to Approved PlansThe land-disturbing activity shall be conducted in accordance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan.\nD. Design and Performance Standards\nDesign StormAdequate erosion control measures, structures, and devices shall be planned, designed, constructed and maintained so as to provide protection from the calculated maximum peak of runoff from the 10-year storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated using the procedures in the USDA, Natural Resource Conservation Service\u2019s (formerly Soil Conservation Service\u2019s) National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices, or other acceptable calculation procedures including, but not limited to, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services Design Manual.\nInnovative MeasuresErosion and sedimentation measures applied alone or in combination to satisfy the intent of this article are acceptable if they are sufficient to prevent adverse secondary consequences. Innovative techniques and ideas shall be considered and may be used following approval by the Stormwater Administrator if it can be demonstrated that such techniques and ideas are likely to produce successful results.\nResponsibility for MaintenanceDuring the development of a tract, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install and maintain all temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentation control measures as required by the approved plan or any section of this article, The North Carolina Sedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973 and all rules and orders adopted pursuant to it (referred to as \u201cAct\u2019 within this article), or any order adopted pursuant to this article or the Act. After development, the landowner or person in possession or control of the land shall install and maintain all necessary permanent erosion and sediment control measures.\nAdditional MeasuresWhenever the Stormwater Administrator determines that accelerated erosion and sedimentation continues or shall likely continue, despite installation and maintenance of protective practices, the person conducting the landdisturbing activity shall be required to take additional protective action necessary to achieve compliance with the conditions specified in this article.\nStorm Drainage Facilities ProtectionPersons shall design the plan and conduct land-disturbing activity so that the post-construction velocity of the 10- year storm does not exceed the maximum nonerosive velocity tolerated by the soil of the receiving watercourse or the soil of the receiving land.\nBorrow and Waste AreasIf the same person conducts the land-disturbing activity and any related borrow or waste activity, the related borrow or waste activity shall constitute part of the land-disturbing activity, unless the borrow or waste activity is regulated under the Mining Act of 1971, N.C.G.S. 74, Article 7, or is a landfill regulated by the Division of Waste Management. If the land-disturbing activity and any related borrow or waste activity are not conducted by the same person, they shall be considered by the approving authority as separate land-disturbing activities.\nTemporary Access and Haul RoadsTemporary access and haul roads, other than public roads, constructed or used in connection with any landdisturbing activity shall be considered a part of such activity.\nOperations in Lakes or WatercoursesLand-disturbing activity in connection with construction in, on, over, or under a lake or watercourse shall be planned and conducted in such a manner as to minimize the extent and duration of disruption of the stream channel. The relocation of a stream, where relocation is an essential part of the proposed activity, shall be planned and executed so as to minimize changes in the stream flow characteristics.\n", "metadataJson": "{\"section_url\": \"/articles/article-28-soil-erosion-sedimentation-control/#283-requirements,-objectives,-and-standards\"}"}, {"title": "28.4 PLANS AND PERMITS", "text": "A.
