Table 33-2: Local Street Matrix describes the type of local street required within each Place Type.C. Table 33-3: Streetscape Reference provides a reference for the required sidewalk/shared-use path and amenity zone or planting strip for each street classification.1\u00a0Any pedestrian facilities on Limited Access roads and Parkways will be in the form of a shared-use path located either in a sidewalk utility easement outside the right-of-way or, with NCDOT approval, at the back of the right-of-way.2\u00a0Where the area between the sidewalk and the back of curb is three feet or more than the required minimum width of an amenity zone, grass or groundcover is permitted in the area that exceeds the required minimum width. If the area between the sidewalk and the back of curb is three feet or less than the required minimum width of an amenity zone, the amenity zone shall extend to the back of curb.3\u00a0Location of trees may be required to be outside the clear zone for North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) facilities.4\u00a0If the Charlotte Streets Map requires an amenity zone, a planting strip is permitted instead of an amenity zone for the TOD-TR Zoning District.5\u00a0If the Chief Urban Forester determines that planting trees in the required planting strip or amenity zone is not feasible due to shallow depth of existing underground utilities, the required trees may be relocated behind the sidewalk. In that case, a minimum four foot planting strip, planted with grass or groundcover, shall be retained for collector and local streets. A minimum eight foot planting strip planted with grass or groundcover shall be retained for arterials.D. Table 33-4: Sidewalk Dimensions \u2013 Collector and Local Streets contains the required dimensions for sidewalks on collector and local streets based on Place Type. For collector and local streets, a shared-use path shall be required instead of a sidewalk when shown on the Charlotte Streets Map.E. Table 33-5: Amenity Zone or Planting Strip \u2013 Collector and Local Streets indicates when amenity zones or planting strips are required and allowed based on Place Type.1\u00a0Planting strips are the standard requirement for these Place Types. Amenity zones may be allowed if the Chief Urban Forester, in consultation with the CDOT Director and Planning Director, determines installation of an amenity zone supports the listed urban forest characteristics for the corresponding Place Type while also supporting other key interests (transportation, sidewalks, etc.)2\u00a0Planting strips are permitted instead of an amenity zone in the TOD-TR Zoning District.3\u00a0Planting strips are permitted for any zoning district located within the Water Supply Watershed Protection Areas per Article 23.", "metadataJson": "{\"section_url\": \"/articles/article-33-standards-for-streets-off-street-public-paths-cross-access/#333-street-design\"}"}, {"title": "33.4 UPTOWN STREETSCAPE DESIGN", "text": "Table 33-6: Uptown Streetscape Design Elements contains the required dimensions for sidewalks and amenity zones and indicates streetscape requirements for amenity zone elements, pavers, lighting, and curb design for Uptown Streets.1\u00a0Tryon Street (within Uptown) shall follow existing Tryon Street Mall Streetscape Guidelines for amenity zone elements, pavers, lighting, and curb design but shall otherwise be classified as an Uptown Signature Street.2\u00a0Utilities are required in Tree Grates.3\u00a0Concrete paver blocks in herringbone are permitted under encroachment agreement from applicable agency.4\u00a0Pedestrian lighting spacing is based on proximity to trees and street lighting, as determined by CDOT.
