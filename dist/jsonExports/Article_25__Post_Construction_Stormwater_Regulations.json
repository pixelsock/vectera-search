Total Phosphorus Mitigation\nPurposeThe purpose of this mitigation is to reduce the cost of complying with the 70% total phosphorus removal criteria for development with greater than or equal to 24% built-upon area while ensuring the reduction of pollution loads and achievement of the objectives of this article\nGeneral Description\n\nThere are two total phosphorus mitigation options available to development greater than or equal to 24% built-upon area: 1) an off-site mitigation option; and 2) a buy-down option as described in this article. Both off-site and buy-down mitigation will result in the construction of retrofit SCMs in the same river basin (Catawba or Yadkin) as the mitigated site. In the Western Catawba District both forms of mitigation shall occur in the watershed of the same named creek system for the purpose of ensuring a balance of total phosphorus loads to lake cove areas where phosphorus is a limiting pollutant with the exception that up to 30% of the buy-down money can be spent outside the watershed. In addition, the buy-down option is available provided the City has projects and/or property available for mitigation. There is no total phosphorus requirement in the Central Catawba District so the mitigation option is not necessary.\nThe named creek (or drainage basin) systems referred to above include:\n\nWestern Catawba: Studman Branch, Porter Branch, Neal Branch, Stowe Branch, Beaverdam Creek, Little Paw Creek, Paw Creek, Long Creek, Gar Creek, and the Lower Mountain Island watershed.\nYadkin-Southeast Catawba: Six Mile Creek, Twelve Mile Creek, Caldwell Creek, McKee Creek, Reedy Creek, Fuda Creek, Back Creek, Mallard Creek, and Lower Clarke Creek.\n\n\n\n\nCriteria for Off-Site Mitigation\n\nThe owner or designee of a proposed construction site that will include greater than or equal to 24% BUA shall construct SCM retrofit project designed to achieve an equivalent or greater net mass removal of total phosphorus as would be achieved by removing 70% of the total phosphorus from the proposed site. Off-site mitigation is allowed only for total phosphorus removal above 50%. On-site SCMs shall be constructed to achieve 50% removal of total phosphorus from the project site.\nThe Stormwater Administrator shall receive and review the application for off-site mitigation. After reviewing the application the Stormwater Administrator shall approve, disapprove, or approve with conditions an \u201cApplication for Off-Site Total Phosphorus Mitigation.\u201d This application shall be submitted with the Stormwater Management Permit application and shall at a minimum contain a description of the SCM(s) to be constructed, including their type and size as well as the pollutant removal efficiencies to be achieved. The location of the site where the SCM(s) are to be constructed shall be described, including the size of the drainage area to be treated and percentage and type of existing BUA. The application shall also include the pounds of total phosphorus being mitigated for and the pounds of total phosphorus reduced with the retrofit SCM(s). Documentation shall be submitted with the application to demonstrate that the applicant has land rights to perform the SCM retrofit on the property.\nThe criteria for approval of off-site total phosphorus mitigation by the Stormwater Administrator are as follows:\n\nSCM(s) shall be constructed in accordance with 15A NCAC 2H.1008(c), as explained in the SCM Design Manual.\nSCM(s) shall be sized for the corresponding watershed area according to the SCM Design Manual.\nSCM(s) shall be inspected by the Stormwater Administrator and found to be in compliance with all approved plans and specifications prior to the issuance of certificate(s) of occupancy for the mitigated site.\n\n\nFollowing approval from the Stormwater Administrator, SCM(s) may be installed and credits obtained for pounds of total phosphorus removed that can be applied to future projects. These credits can be accumulated or banked for a period of time as specified by the Stormwater Administrator in the Administrative Manual.\nAll off-site mitigation SCMs shall be subject to the maintenance requirements as well as installation and maintenance performance securities specified in Section 25.7.\n\n\nCriteria for Total Phosphorus Buy-Down Option\n\nThe owner or designee of a proposed construction site that will include greater than or equal to 24% BUA may buy-down the 70% phosphorus removal requirement to no less than 50%. On-site SCMs shall be installed to remove the remaining total phosphorus load. The funds shall be used by the City to construct SCM retrofit projects designed to achieve an equivalent or greater net mass removal of total phosphorus as would be achieved by removing 70% of the total phosphorus from the proposed site.\nThe Stormwater Administrator shall receive and review the application for the buy-down option. After receiving the application the Stormwater Administrator shall approve, disapprove, or approve with conditions an application for total phosphorus buy-down.
