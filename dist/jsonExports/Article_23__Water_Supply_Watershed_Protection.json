Mountain Island Lake WatershedVegetative buffers are required along the shoreline of Mountain Island Lake measured from the full pond elevation and along all perennial streams measured from the top of bank on each side of the stream. Required minimum buffer widths are indicated in Table 23-4.B. Lake Wylie WatershedVegetative buffers are required along the shoreline of the Lake Wylie measured from the full pond elevation and along all perennial streams measured from the top of bank on each side of the stream. Required minimum buffer widths are indicated in Table 23-5.C. Lower Lake Wylie Watershed\nVegetative buffers are required along the shoreline of the Lower Lake Wylie measured from the full pond elevation and along all perennial streams measured from the top of bank on each side of the stream. Required minimum buffer widths are indicated in Table 23-6.\n\nRequired Water Quality Buffer Width IncreaseRequired minimum buffer width shall be increased by 50% for new developments under the High-Density Option located along the lakeshore that have average slopes equal to or greater than 50% within the 100 foot buffer. The average slope is calculated by measuring the slope from the highest and lowest elevations at the 100 foot buffer to the 569.4 foot full pond elevation of Lake Wylie. The sum of the two measurements is divided by two to determine the average slope within the 100 foot buffer. The additional buffer area is applied in areas of the tract where slopes are greatest to obtain the maximum benefit from the increased buffer area.\nShoreline Stabilization RequiredIf a building permit is required for property improvement under the High-Density Option, which will result in an increase in built-upon area (BUA), shoreline stabilization is required as needed and allowed when unstable shorelines are present, and as approved on a plan submitted to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services (CMSWS) and as allowed by Duke Energy Lake Services.\nMitigationUnless exempted below, water quality buffer impacts are allowed only with the approval of a site-specific mitigation plan by CMSWS and/or approval of a variance per Article 37, if a variance is required. The following techniques are available for mitigation. Specifications for these pre-approved mitigation techniques are provided in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Water Quality Buffer Implementation Guidelines.\n\nInstallation of Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs)If not required by another City ordinance or regulation of this Ordinance, the installation of an on-site SCM designed to achieve specified pollutant removal targets will allow for water quality buffer impacts on the specific site. The SCM should remain outside the Stream Side Zone if practical. A detailed SCM design plan shall be submitted to CMSWS for approval based on specifications and pollutant removal targets contained in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Stormwater Control Measure Design Manual (SCM Design Manual). This plan shall also include a long-term maintenance strategy for the SCM complete with the establishment of adequate financing to support the proposed maintenance practices.\nWater Quality Buffer RestorationThe owner may restore and preserve the buffer area on any stream of equivalent or greater drainage area, the condition of which is determined to be qualified for restoration by CMSWS. This restored buffer area shall be equal or greater in size than the buffer area to be mitigated.\nWater Quality Buffer PreservationThe owner may purchase, fee simple, other stream segments at equivalent or greater drainage area on a 1:1 linear foot basis and convey fee simple and absolute title to the land to the City of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, or approved conservation organization. Staff may consider other means for preserving these areas on a case-by-case basis.\nMitigation CreditsThe purchase of mitigation credits on a 1:1 basis utilizing area of water quality buffer impacted and the prevailing rate of purchase as established by CMSWS shall allow for water quality buffer impacts on the specific site. Mitigation credits purchased under any other program (i.e., U.S. Army Corp of Engineers) shall not cover this requirement unless the issuing agency agrees to relinquish the funds to CMSWS.\n\n\nD. Additional Water Quality Buffer Requirements (All Watersheds)\nNo permanent structures, built upon areas, septic systems, or any other disturbance of existing vegetation is allowed within the water quality buffer except as follows:\n\nNo trees larger than a two-inch caliper are to be removed except for dead or diseased trees. Trees less than a two-inch caliper and undergrowth may be removed to be replaced by an effective stabilization and filtering groundcover based upon the \u201cCharlotte-Mecklenburg Water Quality Buffer Implementation Guidelines.\u201d\nStream bank or shoreline stabilization is allowed as approved on a plan submitted to CMSWS.\nWater dependent structures and public projects, such as transportation crossings, public utilities, and greenway paths, are allowed where no practical alternative exists. These activities should minimize builtupon area, direct runoff away from surface waters, and maximize the utilization of nonstructural BMPs and pervious materials.\nNon-impervious recreational development and non-impervious pedestrian trails may be allowed in the required water quality buffer if located a minimum of 30 feet from the stream bank. This provision does not apply to the Mountain Island Lake Watershed Critical Areas.\n\n\nThe following may be located within water supply water quality buffers when they meet the minimum requirements of this article and the articles listed below:\n\nRequired open space per Article 16.\nLandscape yard per Article 20.\nAmenitized tree areas per Article 20.\nTree save per Article 20.\nInternal trees per Article 20.\nPerimeter trees per Article 20.\nWater supply water quality buffer per Article 23.\nPost-construction water quality buffer per Article 25.\nSWIM water quality buffer per Article 26.\nFloodplain per Article 27.\nAreas for greenways or parks per Article 32 offered for dedication and accepted by Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation.\n\n\n", "metadataJson": "{\"section_url\": \"/articles/article-23-water-supply-watershed-protection/#236-water-quality-buffer-requirements\"}"}, {"title": "23.7 HIGH-DENSITY OPTION", "text": "The High-Density Option allows for a greater development density, provided SCMs are installed.A.
