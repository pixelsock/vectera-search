Residential Street DesignResidential street design will ensure the creation of a network of low volume, low speed streets. All new development shall provide for more than one access for ingress and egress, where feasible. The proposed street system will extend existing streets on their proper projections. To the greatest extent practicable, cul-de-sacs and other permanently dead-end streets are to be avoided.B. Relationship to Railroad Rights-of-WayWhen a subdivision adjoins a railroad right-of-way, the subdivider may be required to arrange the street pattern to provide for future grade separation of street and railroad crossings, except where no such crossing will be allowed by the railroad.C. Partial StreetsWhenever an existing partial street is adjacent to a tract of land to be subdivided, the remaining portion of the street shall be platted within such tract. New partial streets shall meet the standards of Tables 34-2 and 34-4.D. Mature Trees and Natural VegetationStreets and development sites shall be designed to protect and preserve, to the greatest extent practicable, stands of mature trees and other areas of significant natural vegetation.E. Access to Parks, Schools, GreenwaysStreets shall be designed, or walkways dedicated, to ensure convenient access to parks, greenways, playgrounds, educational facilities, and other places of public assembly.F. Parallel Streets Along Limited Access Roads and Arterial StreetsWhere a tract of land to be subdivided adjoins a federal or state highway, limited access road, or arterial that is not a Main Street, the subdivider may be required to provide a street parallel to the highway or to utilize reverse frontage on an interior street for lots developed adjacent to the highway. Where reverse frontage is established, deed restrictions or other means should be provided to prevent driveways from having direct access to the highway or street at the rear lot line.G. Public School and Public Park SitesWhen a tract of land that appears in any adopted plan or policy document as a future public school, public park, or greenway falls within an area proposed to be subdivided, the Planning Department staff shall notify the appropriate agency of the proposed subdivision and its effect on the future public site. The appropriate agency shall decide within 30 days if it wishes to reserve the site for future acquisition.\nIf the site is not to be reserved, the subdivision shall be processed in the normal fashion.\nIf the agency does wish to reserve the site, the subdivision shall not be approved without such reservation.\n\nThe appropriate agency shall have 18 months from the date of preliminary plan approval to acquire the site by purchase, by receipt of a dedication, or by initiating condemnation proceedings.\nIf, at the end of the 18 month period, none of the actions listed above has commenced, the subdivider may consider the land free of any reservation.\nThe subdivider may choose to dedicate the area to be reserved.\n\n\nH. Public FacilitiesWhen a tract of land that appears in any adopted plan or policy document as a future site for any community service facility including, but not limited to, police and fire stations, libraries, public housing, or other public use sites, falls within an area proposed to be subdivided, the Planning Department staff shall notify the appropriate agency of the proposed subdivision and its effect on the future public site.

This requirement applies to such lines installed at the time of the development of the subdivision and to easements for such lines which may reasonably be expected to be installed in the future. A sidewalk and utility easement (SUE) shall be shown two feet off the back of any sidewalk on a public street or shared-use path located partially or completely outside of the public right-of-way. If a building is two or more feet behind the required sidewalk or shared-use path, the two foot space shall be in the right-of-way, a SUE, or a combination of both.K. Proposed Water and Sewer SystemThe preliminary subdivision plan should be accompanied by satisfactory evidence as to the proposed method of providing potable water and a system of sanitary sewage collection and disposal as per the requirements of Sections 34.2 and 34.3.L. Restrictions on Subdivision of Land Subject to FloodingLots that are subject to flooding should not be established in subdivisions, except as provided in Section 24.3.C.M. Lots with Water AccessWhere a subdivision which adjoins the Catawba River or its impounded waters contains interior lots, parcels or tracts of land which do not adjoin the water\u2019s edge, but any part of which is within 450 feet of the water\u2019s edge, one or more lots which adjoin the water\u2019s edge shall be reserved to provide water access for the owners of interior properties. Such lots shall be called water access lots. If property which is in the same ownership adjoins the subdivision, such property shall be construed as being part of the subdivision for purposes of determining requirements of water access lots.Water access lots shall equal at least 10% of the area, exclusive of streets, of all the interior property which lies within 450 feet of the water\u2019s edge. However, where the 10% would equal less than 20,000 square feet, the subdivider shall not be required to provide any water access lots. All water access lots shall have a minimum frontage at the water\u2019s edge of 100 feet. The water access lots shall either be dedicated to Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation Department (only if the Mecklenburg County Board of County Commissioners agrees to accept such dedication) or be transferred in fee simple title to a homeowners association of the interior lot owners of the subdivision. Before approval of the final plat, the subdivider shall submit to the Planning Department a covenant stating either that:\nThey shall dedicate the required amount of water access lots to the County; or\nThey shall convey title of the water access lots to a homeowners association of the purchasers of each interior lot.\nIf the subdivider chooses to dedicate the water access lots to the County, the Board of County Commissioners shall have agreed to accept the final responsibility of maintaining the lots, and the preliminary plan and final plat shall show the dedication.
