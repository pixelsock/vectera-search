Conventional zoning districts allow a variety of uses permitted under the development standards of the zoning district.\nConditional Zoning Map AmendmentA conditional zoning map amendment is a legislative process in which a petitioner proposes, and the City Council considers, a zoning map amendment to a conditional zoning district that includes a site plan and individualized additional site-specific commitments. Site-specific conditions may also be proposed by the petitioner or the City, but only those site-specific conditions approved by the City and consented to by the petitioner in writing may be incorporated into the petition.

No modifications shall be made to the uses or maximum height regulations, with the exception of the height limitations when adjacent to the Neighborhood 1 Place Type. It provides a mechanism for City Council to review and consider new development concepts, innovative designs, special problems, and other unique proposals or circumstances that cannot be accommodated by the standards of a zoning district, while addressing the conformance of the development and use of the site to other applicable standards, the Comprehensive Plan, and/or the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site.\n\nDistricts AllowedThe establishment of an exception (EX) district is allowed in the following districts:\n\nIn the following Transit Oriented Development Zoning Districts: TOD-UC, TOD-NC, TOC-CC, and TOD-TR.

An exception (EX) district will be referred to as UC(EX), UE(EX), or RAC(EX), depending on the base zoning district.\nIn the following Community Activity Center Zoning Districts: CAC-1, CAC-2. An exception (EX) district will be referred to as CAC-1(EX) or CAC-2(EX), depending on the base zoning district.\nIn the following Neighborhood Center Zoning Districts: NC. An exception (EX) district will be referred to as NC(EX).\nIn the following Innovation Mixed-Use Zoning Districts: IMU. An exception (EX) district will be referred to as IMU(EX).\nIn the following Campus Zoning Districts: IC-2 and RC. An exception (EX) district will be referred to as IC-2(EX) or RC(EX), depending on the base zoning district.\nIn the following Neighborhood 2 Zoning Districts: N2-C.

Also, no modifications to the proposed zoning map amendment shall be made at the hearing; however, potential modifications proposed by the petitioner, Planning Commission, City Council, and other interested parties may be considered by the City Council at the time of the hearing, if offered.\nIf modification to the petition is proposed by the petitioner after the public hearing, and before the Planning Commission recommendation, the Planning Commission shall evaluate whether a modification is substantial enough to recommend another public hearing, and make a recommendation to the City Council.\nIf the Planning Commission does not recommend another public hearing of a modified petition, it may defer action on the petition to a set date in order for staff and other interested parties to have the opportunity to review and comment on the amendment to the petition.\nIf the Planning Commission recommends that the modified petition move forward without recommending a deferral or new public hearing, the Planning Commission shall consider the revised petition and forward its recommendation to the City Council.\nIf a modification to the petition is proposed by the petitioner after the public hearing and the Planning Commission recommendation, the planning staff shall evaluate whether the modification is substantial enough to recommend another public hearing and make a recommendation to the City Council.\nIf the Planning Commission recommends that the modified petition move forward without recommending a deferral or new public hearing, the Planning Commission shall consider the revised petition and forward its recommendation to the City Council.\nEven if the Planning Commission or Planning staff does not recommend a new public hearing, the City Council may, at its discretion, schedule the modified petition for a new public hearing, preceded by the notice required in Section 37.2.I.\nIf the petitioner wishes to modify the proposed zoning map amendment after the Planning Commission\u2019s recommendation and prior to a vote by the City Council, then prior to the time of the vote, the City Council shall refer the modified petition to the Planning Commission for a new review and a potentially updated recommendation unless the City Council, by a three-fourths vote of all members present, except members properly excused from voting, determines that the nature of the modification is such that the Planning Commission review and potential updated recommendation is not necessary.\n\n\n\n\n*R.* \u00a0Effect of Approval and Denial of Zoning Map Amendment\n\nEffect of ApprovalIf a petition for zoning map amendment to a conditional zoning, including an exception (EX) district, is approved, the development and use of the property shall be governed by the requirements of the zoning regulations in place at the time of the zoning map amendment approval, as well as the site plan and conditions of the approved conditional zoning district.\nEffect of Denial\n\nA petition for a zoning map amendment for a property that has been denied, in whole or in part, or approved to a zoning district other than the one originally requested, shall not be resubmitted within two years of the date of the City Council\u2019s action on the original petition, except as permitted in item b below. This section shall not apply to rezoning petitions initiated by someone other than the property owner or authorized agent.\nThe City Council may, by a majority vote, allow resubmission of a zoning map amendment petition within the two-year time frame if it determines that, since the date of action on the prior petition, one or more of the following guidelines have been met:\n\nThere has been a similar or more intensive change in the zoning district designation of an adjacent property.\nThe City Council has adopted a public policy plan, an updated Comprehensive Plan, an area plan, or a transportation plan that changes public policy regarding how the property affected by the amendment should be developed.\nConstruction or expansion of a road, water line, sewer line, or other infrastructure has occurred to serve the property and which infrastructure can accommodate the intensity of development allowed under the proposed classification.\nThere has been some other substantial change in conditions or circumstances which justifies waiver of the two-year restriction on a new petition. This shall not include a change in the ownership of the subject property or, in the case of a petition for a zoning map amendment to a conditional zoning district, a change in the scale or features of the development proposed in the prior petition.\n\n\nPrior to voting on the resubmission, the City Council shall receive a report from the Planning Department containing its recommendations on resubmission of the petition.\n\n\n\n\n*S.* Changes to an Approved Conditional and Exception (EX) District Rezoning PetitionsChanges to approved conditional and exception (EX) plans and conditions of development will require a new application for a zoning map amendment, with a new public hearing, unless an approved administrative amendment, administrative minor adjustment, or variance is approved to allow the change\n*T.* Expiration of Zoning Map Amendment PetitionIf a decision on a proposed zoning map amendment has not been reached within two years from the date the zoning map amendment petition is submitted and deemed complete, then the petition shall become null and void.\n", "metadataJson": "{\"section_url\": \"/articles/article-37-amendments-development-approvals/#372-zoning-map-amendments\"}"}, {"title": "37.3 ADMINISTRATIVE MINOR AMENDMENTS", "text": "A.

Accompanying the petition shall be the applicable fee for administrative review. Upon request, the petitioner shall provide any additional information that is requested.\nIf multiple parcels of land are subject to an approved conditional or exception (EX) district, the owners of individual parcels may apply for an administrative minor amendment to modify the conditions on their parcels so long as the modification would not result in other properties failing to meet the approved site plan, conditions, and standards of the zoning district and other regulations in the UDO or remove entitlements from other individual parcels without the owner\u2019s consent. Any modifications approved through an administrative minor amendment shall apply only to those properties whose owners apply for the administrative minor amendment.\nAny changes that increase the density (number of dwelling units per acre) of the development or change allowed uses are considered to be significant changes that cannot be considered through an administrative minor amendment and shall go through the zoning map approval process to amend the conditional or exception (EX) site plan and conditions. Other significant changes to an approved site plan that cannot be considered an administrative minor amendment include the following:\n\nIncreasing the number of buildings.\nAdding driveway connections to arterials or limited access roads.\nReducing vehicular or bicycle parking spaces below the minimum number or above the maximum number in conditional and exception (EX) plans.\nReducing landscape yards and setbacks.\nMoving structures closer to abutting properties in a Neighborhood 1 Place Type or Neighborhood 2 Place Type or closer to a single family, duplex, triplex, or quadraplex dwelling.\nReducing open space.\nChanging owner occupied units to rental if noted on the site plan.\nIncreasing the mass of buildings.\n\n\n\n\nStaff Authority and Decision\n\nThe Planning Director shall have the authority to approve or deny an administrative minor amendment to an approved conditional or exception (EX) plan or conditions. The standard for approving or denying such a requested change shall be that the change does not significantly alter the site plan or its conditions and the change does not have a significant impact upon abutting properties.\nThe Planning Director shall also have the discretion to decline to exercise the authority due to uncertainty about approval of the change pursuant to the standard or because a rezoning petition for a public hearing and City Council consideration is deemed appropriate under the circumstances. If the Planning Director declines to exercise this authority, then the applicant can only file a rezoning petition for a new public hearing and Council decision.\n\n\nNotification of DecisionThe Planning Director making the decision on a request for an administrative minor amendment shall give written notice to the property owner and to the party who sought the decision, if different from the property owner.

The designated administrator shall inform the relevant abutting owner(s) that the owner is entitled to object. The abutting owner(s) shall have ten working days from the date of the letter to make comments to the Administrator. The designated administrator shall take into consideration any comments received.

An inadvertent error includes, but is not limited to, a surveying error, a misunderstanding of a property line, or an error on the part of City or County staff.\n\n\nFor other administrative adjustment requests, the designated administrator shall review the administrative adjustment request against the following standards and determine that the adjustment meets each standard:\n\nIs consistent with the overall intent of the applicable regulation or zoning district.\nRelieves a minor practical difficulty or supports compliance with ADA standards.\nDoes not have a negative impact on public health, safety, and welfare.\n\n\n\n\nDecision and Notification\n\nThe designated administrator may approve or deny the administrative adjustment. The administrator may also determine that the proposed adjustment is outside of the general intent of an administrative adjustment and decline to review the administrative adjustment.\nThe designated administrator shall give written notice to the owner of the property and to the party that sought the decision, if different from the property owner.

Applicability\nThe establishment of a vested right in this section does not preclude vesting under one or more of the other types of vesting outlined in this section.\nA vested right, once established, precludes any action by the City that would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property allowed by the applicable land development regulations(s), except where a change in State or federal law mandating City and County enforcement occurs after the development application is submitted that has a fundamental and retroactive effect on the development or use.\nVested rights run with the land, except for the use of land for outdoor advertising governed by N.C.G.S. Chapter 136-131.1 and 136-131.2 in which case the vested rights granted run with the owner of a permit issued by the North Carolina Department of Transportation.\nB. Site-Specific Vesting PlansA site-specific vesting plan is a development plan in which the applicant receives vesting approved by City Council. A site-specific plan provides a description of the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel(s) of property. The approval of such plans gives the owner the right to undertake and complete the development and use of said property under the terms and conditions of the site specific development plan, in accordance with N.C.G.S. Chapter 160D\u00ad108.1(a), (b), and (c), including any amendments.\nSite-Specific Development PlansConditional district (CD) and exception (EX) zoning map amendments are identified as site-specific vesting plans in this Ordinance.\nApproval\n\nA site-specific vesting plan associated with a conditional (CD) or exception EX zoning map amendment is approved by City Council, after notice and a legislative public hearing in accordance with Section 37.2, \u201cZoning Map Amendments.\u201d\nA vested right becomes effective upon the date of approval.\n\n\nDurationConditional and exception (EX) zoning map amendments are vested for a period of two years. An extended five-year vesting may be requested by a petitioner and approved by City Council through a zoning map amendment, for development where such extended period is warranted in light of all relevant circumstances, including but not limited to, the size and phasing of development, the level of investment, the need for the development, economic cycles, and market conditions, or other considerations.\nTerminationA site-specific vested right terminates at the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed.\nC. Multi-Phased Development Vesting PlansA multi-phase development is a development containing at least 25 acres or more, planned to be developed in more than one phase, and subject to a master plan. A multi-phased development plan provides a description of committed elements including the type and intensity of uses for each phase.\nApprovalA multi-phased development plan including committed elements showing the type and intensity of use for each phase associated with a conditional (CD) or exception (EX) zoning map amendment is approved by City Council, after notice and a legislative public hearing in accordance with Section 37.2, \u201cZoning Map Amendments.\u201d\nDurationThe entire multi-phase development is vested at the time of the site plan approval of a conditional (CD) or exception (EX) zoning map amendment. The vesting is valid for seven years and is for the development regulations in place at the time of the approval.\nTerminationA vested right for a multi-phased development plan expires at the end of the applicable vesting period.\nD. Other Provisions for Site-Specific and Multi-Phased Development Vesting Plans\nIf a variance is required for a site-specific plan, it shall be obtained prior to the approval of a site-specific vesting plan, per N.C.G.S. 160D-108.1(a).\nApproval of site-specific vesting does not preclude the application of overlay zoning regulations which impose additional requirements, but do not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or regulations which are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to development regulation.\nNew zoning regulations that occur after the approval of site-specific and multi-phased development vesting plans do not override the specific conditions and zoning regulations in effect at the time of approval of the conditional (CD) or exception (EX) site-specific or multi-phased development plans.\nFollowing approval of a site-specific or multi-phased development vesting plan, the City and/or County may make subsequent reviews and require subsequent approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval.\nAn approved site-specific or multi-phased development vesting plan and its conditions may be amended with the approval of the owner and the City through a zoning map amendment in accordance with Section 37.2, or through an administrative minor amendment in accordance with Section 37.3.\nThe establishment of a site-specific or multi-phased development vested right does not preclude, change, or impair the authority of the City to adopt and enforce development regulations governing nonconforming situations or uses.\nThe City may revoke the original site-specific or multi-phased development plan approval for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions of the original approval or the applicable local development regulations in accordance with N.C.G.S. Chapter 160D-403(f).\nE. Preliminary Subdivision Plan Vesting\nApprovalA preliminary subdivision plan is approved by the Subdivision, Streets, and Infrastructure Administrator in accordance with Section 30.6.\nDurationA preliminary subdivision plan approval is vested for a period of three years, allowing the developer to begin construction, including installation of utilities associated with the plan approval. After the installation has occurred, the plan remains valid until construction is complete. If no construction is started within three years, the preliminary subdivision plan is no longer valid and a new plan submittal and approval are required.\nF. Development Permit Vesting ProvisionsDevelopment permits are administrative and quasi-judicial approvals that are required prior to commencing development or undertaking a specific activity, project, or development proposal, including, but not limited to, zoning permits, sign permits, site plan approvals, variances, certificates of appropriateness, driveway permits, soil erosion and sedimentation control permits, stormwater and land disturbance permits.\nApprovalUpon approval and issuance of a development permit, vesting becomes effective upon the date the application was filed, as long as the permit remains valid, in accordance with N.C.G.S. Chapter 143-755.\nDurationDevelopment permit approvals are vested for 12 months from the date the application was filed, and expires at 12 months unless work authorized by the permit is substantially commenced, or a development regulation provides for a longer permit expiration period, or the development regulation allows for time extension beyond the original 12 months, or provides a renewal process.\nTerminationThe vested right for a development permit shall expire for an uncompleted development project if development work is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than 24 consecutive months.\nG. Common Law Vested RightA common law vested right establishes the right to undertake and complete the development and use of property where substantial expenditure of resources (which can include the expenditure of money, time, and/or labor) were made in good faith and the expenditures were made in reliance on a valid development permit or development approval. A person claiming a common law vested right shall submit information to substantiate that claim to the designated administrator that demonstrates that substantial expenditures were made relying in good faith on a valid development permit or development approval. The designated administrator shall make a determination as to the existence of the vested right, as provided in N.C.G.S. \u00a7 160D-108(h). Nothing in this section precludes judicial determination, based on common law principles or other statutory provisions, that a vested right exists in a particular case or that a compensable taking has occurred. Except as expressly provided in \u00a7160D-108, nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the existing common law.", "metadataJson": "{\"section_url\": \"/articles/article-37-amendments-development-approvals/#376-vested-rights\"}"}, {"title": "37.7 PERMIT CHOICE", "text": "A.

This record shall provide a description of each project receiving a variance and the reasons for granting the variance.\n\n\nVariances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon the determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation shall not preclude the structure\u2019s continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.\nThe fact that the property could be utilized more profitably or conveniently with the variance than without the variance shall not be considered as grounds for granting the variance.\nAny person or entity who wishes to receive a copy of the written decision of the UDO Board of Adjustment, shall file a written request for a copy of the UDO Board of Adjustment decision with the clerk to the UDO Board of Adjustment prior to the date the decision becomes effective.\n\n\nStandards for Granting a Variance\n\nStandards Applicable to VariancesWhen unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of zoning and development regulations, the UDO Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the provisions upon a showing of all of the following:\n\nUnnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the regulation. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.\nThe hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. \u00a0Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with a disability.\nThe hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.\nThe requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the regulation, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.Additional factors for consideration in granting Floodplain Variances are provided in Section 37.8.A.13.b. Additional factors for consideration in granting Water Supply Watershed Protection Variances are provided in Section 37.8.A.13.c.\n\n\nFloodplain Variance -Factors for Consideration\n\nFloodplain variances shall only be issued prior to approval of a floodplain development permit. In acting upon variances, in addition to the standards for granting a variance in this section, the UDO Board of Adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all standards of Article 27, and the following in making their decision:\n\n*(A)*Danger that materials allowed to be placed in the floodway as a result of the variance may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others during a community base flood.\n*(B)*Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage from a community base flood.\n*(C)*Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage during the community base flood.\n*(D)*mportance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community.\n*(E)*Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable.\n*(F)*Availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage during a community base flood, for the proposed use.\n*(G)*Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development.\n*(H)*Relationship of the proposed use to the Floodplain Regulations Technical Guidance Document, Mecklenburg County Hazard Mitigation Plans, the Mecklenburg County Greenway Plan, and any other adopted land use plans for that area.\n*(I)*Safety of access to the property in times of a community base flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.\n*(J)*Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters during a community base flood expected at the site.\n*(K)*Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood events, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems and streets and bridges.\n\n\nIn addition to the other factors for consideration in this section, the following shall apply to floodplain variances:\n\n*(A)*Floodplain variances shall not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances.\n*(B)*Floodplain variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if the variance would result in any increase in flood heights during the community and/or FEMA base flood discharge unless the requirements of Section 27.4.E are met.\n*(C)*Floodplain variances shall not be issued that would result in additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with other existing local laws or ordinances.\n*(D)*Floodplain variances shall be considered if the variance request is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.\n*(E)*Variances may be issued for functionally dependent facilities, if determined to meet the definition of Article 27, provided the provisions of Sections 27.3 and 27.4 have been satisfied, and such facilities are protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.\n*(F)*A floodplain variance to the requirement for dryland access may be granted by the UDO Board of Adjustment if dryland access cannot be obtained, upon consideration of the following conditions:\n\n*(1)* A determination that all possible alternatives have been investigated in an attempt to provide the safest access from a proposed habitable building to a dry public street.\n*(2)* The existence of a site plan prepared by a North Carolina Professional Land Surveyor or North Carolina Professional Engineer indicating that the proposed access to habitable buildings on the property poses the least risk from flooding.\n\n\n*(G)*A floodplain variance may be issued by the UDO Board of Adjustment for solid waste disposal facilities, hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities that are located in special flood hazard areas provided that all of the following criteria are met:\n\n*(1)*The use serves a critical need in the community.\n*(2)*No feasible location exists for the use outside the special flood hazard areas.\n*(3)*The lowest floor of any structure is elevated above the FPE or is designed and sealed by a North Carolina Professional Engineer or a North Carolina Licensed Architect to be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.\n*(4)*There shall be no storage of materials or tanks which could flood within the special flood hazard area unless they are contained in a structure as defined in item (3) above.\n*(5)*The use complies with all other applicable laws and regulations.\n*(6)*The City has notified the Secretary of the State Department of Crime Control and Public Safety of its intention to grant a variance at least 30 calendar days prior to granting the variance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater Supply Watershed Protection Variances (Article 23)\n\nA watershed variance that would not result in a relaxation of the state watershed standards shall comply with the procedures and standards of Section 37.8.A.\nA major watershed variance is a variance that would result in the relaxation of a state watershed standard and any one or more of the following and shall comply with the procedures and standards of 37.8.A.13.c for major watershed variances:\n\n*(A)*The relaxation, by a factor greater than 10%, of any management requirement under the Low-Density Option.\n*(B)*The relaxation, by a factor greater than 5% of any water quality buffer, density, or built-upon area requirement under the High-Density Option.\n*(C)*Any variation in the design, maintenance, or operation requirements of a wet detention pond or other approved storm water management system.\n\n\nA minor watershed variance is a variance that would result in the relaxation of a state watershed standard and any one or more of the following and shall comply with the procedures and standards of 37.8.A.13.c for minor watershed variances:\n\n*(A)*The relaxation, by a factor less than 10%, of any management requirement under the Low-Density Option.\n*(B)*The relaxation, by a factor less than 5% of any water quality buffer, density, or built-upon area requirement under the High-Density Option.\n\n\nThe UDO Board of Adjustment and the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC), in granting a minor or major watershed variance, shall ensure that the project will provide equal or better protection of North Carolina waters than the requirements of Rules 15A NCAC 02B .0621\u00ad.0624 of the North Carolina Administrative Code and that the stormwater controls will function in perpetuity.\n\n\n\n\nWritten
