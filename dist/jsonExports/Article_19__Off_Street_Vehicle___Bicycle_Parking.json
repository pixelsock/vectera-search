Vehicle Parking Space Tier System\nTable 19-1: Vehicle Parking Requirements are structured in a three-tier system as follows:\n\nTier 1: A minimum number of off-street parking spaces are required. There are no off-street parking space maximums.\nTier 2: A minimum number of off-street parking spaces are required. There are also off-street parking space maximums.\nTier 3: A minimum number of off-street parking spaces are required for a limited number of uses and locations, but most uses do not have a minimum parking requirement. There are also off-street parking space maximums.\n\nTier 3 required parking minimums may be reduced or eliminated upon Planning Director approval of a Parking Demand Management Assessment, as described in the Charlotte Streets Manual.\n\n\n\n\nThe tier that is applicable to each zoning district is identified in Table 19-1.\nWhere a cell is blank and shaded, no minimum and/or maximum parking is required.\nB. Calculation of Vehicle Parking SpacesVehicle parking spaces are calculated by the principal use of the lot. When more than one principal use occupies the same lot, the number of spaces is the sum of the separate requirements for each principal use.C. Minimum Off-Street Parking Space Requirements\nWhen minimum off-street parking spaces are required by Table 19-1, the minimum vehicle parking requirements apply when any of the following occurs:\n\nNew construction of a principal building.\nExpansion of an existing principal building resulting in a requirement of more than ten additional spaces.\nChange of use or expansion of an existing use resulting in a requirement of more than ten additional spaces.\n\n\nFor existing parking facilities, the number of off-street vehicle spaces shall not be reduced below any minimum parking requirements of this Ordinance. If the number of such existing spaces is already less than the minimum required, it shall not be further reduced. However, if required streetscape improvements, curb relocation, or other requirements of this Ordinance cause the elimination of off-street parking spaces, these spaces need not be replaced.\nD.\u00a0Minimum Off-Street Parking Space Flexibilities\nOn-Street Parking SpacesExisting on-street parking spaces abutting the property may be counted toward required minimum off-street parking spaces. New on-street parking spaces abutting the property may also count toward required minimum off-street parking.\n\nWhere on-street parking spaces are unmarked, the number of parking spaces is calculated by dividing the length of the on-street parking area abutting the property by the length required for a parallel parking space in the Charlotte Land Development Standards Manual (CLDSM).\nWhere on-street parking spaces are marked, each marked space counts as one required parking space, including any space where at least 50% of the length is abutting the property.\nSpaces shall be accessible to the public 24 hours a day.\nIn the event that the city or state removes any such on-street parking that was allowed to count toward the minimum required, the existing use will not be required to make up the difference and the parking will not be made nonconforming.\n\n\nPublic Parking ReductionDevelopment sites located within 1,000 feet walking distance of public parking facilities may be granted a 20%reduction from the minimum parking requirement. Public parking facilities shall be owned or operated by a government agency or municipal service district, or developed as a public-private partnership, but do not include \u201cpark and ride\u201d facilities for public transit.\nExisting Structures or Tree PreservationIn the event that the required minimum parking spaces cannot be placed on the lot without the demolition of an existing structure or causing damage to significant trees on the site or in the public right-of-way, the Zoning Administrator may authorize up to a 25% reduction in the total number of minimum parking spaces required on the lot. In the case of significant trees, the Zoning Administrator shall consult with the Chief Urban Forester prior to authorization of the reduction.\n\nThe Zoning Administrator may issue such an authorization only upon the request of the applicant and only upon determining that the reduction in the number of required parking spaces will not unreasonably increase parking congestion along public streets or in parking areas located on nearby lots.\nIf such authorization is granted, the applicant shall not demolish or remove the existing structure or trees unless the full required number of off-street parking spaces are provided on the lot.\nThe Zoning Administrator may request measures be taken to help mitigate the reduction in parking. These mitigations may include, but are not limited to, pedestrian connections to public sidewalks and additional bicycle parking accommodations.\n\n\nE. Parking Maximum Limitations for Existing FacilitiesIn the Transit Oriented Development Zoning Districts and the UC Zoning District, when at least 50% of the parking lot area is reconstructed, such parking lot shall meet any required parking maximums. Resealing, repaving, resurfacing, and/or re-striping of an existing parking lot are not considered reconstruction.F. Spaces Exempt from Parking MaximumsSpaces reserved for the following are not included in calculating parking maximums:\nRequired accessible parking spaces in compliance with City, state, and federal standards.\nEVSE-Installed electric vehicle charging stations (Section 19.3).\nThe following pick-up/drop-off spaces, which shall be marked as reserved:\n\nRide-hailing service vehicles.\nQuick-commerce delivery vehicles.\nSafe exchange zones, such as designated spaces in public areas for receipt of goods purchased online\n\n\nOn-street parking spaces abutting the site.\nOn-site visitor spaces for multi-family dwellings to a maximum exception of ten spaces or 10% of the total number of on-site dwelling units (in spaces), whichever is greater. All such spaces shall be marked as available for visitor use.\nG. Permissions to Exceed Parking Maximums\nA parking maximum may be exceeded by up to 25% if one or more of the following are met:\n\n10% of the total number of spaces are provided for public use 24 hours a day and seven days a week.\n20% of the total number of spaces are provided for public use as shared spaces available from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.\n20% of the total number of spaces are provided for public use as shared spaces available from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m., seven days a week.\n\n\nWhen public use spaces are provided in order to exceed a parking maximum, the following apply:\n\nWhen located within a parking structure, public use spaces shall be located within the first two floors of the structure.\nSignage shall be provided that indicates the location of public use spaces.\nShared spaces that are not available 24 hours a day and seven days a week shall be clearly marked with the hours of availability for public use.\nThe facility may charge for the use of for public parking spaces.\n\n\nPublic transit facilities shall be exempt from parking maximums.\nH. Alternative Parking Near Existing Transit StationsAny property within one-half mile walking distance of an existing rapid transit station may use the Tier 3 parking standards, unless the property is located in a Neighborhood 1 Place Type. If Tier 3 parking standards are used, such standards shall be used in their entirety, including any applicable parking minimums and maximums.I.
