To appropriately address multimodal and context-based impacts and mitigations, the CTR includes three types of analyses, including Multimodal Assessments, Transportation Demand Management (TDM), and Traffic Impact Studies (TIS).B. RequirementThe CTR, including specific thresholds and requirements, is included in the Charlotte Streets Manual (Streets Manual). A CTR is required for any development project that meets or exceeds any specified threshold. The developer shall procure the CTR at their own expense, and the CTR shall satisfy all applicable requirements.C. MitigationBased on the results or recommendations of a CTR, the developer shall provide any required mitigation and shall also abide by all applicable CTR procedures and requirements in providing such mitigation. Any mitigation required by the CTR shall be included along with all other transportation requirements of the proposed development as required by this Ordinance and other applicable law.", "metadataJson": "{\"section_url\": \"/articles/article-32-required-new-streets-transportation-improvements/#321-comprehensive-transportation-review-(ctr)\"}"}, {"title": "32.2 TRANSPORTATION ADJUSTMENTS", "text": "A.

Right-of-way dedication shall still be required.\nThe requirement to update existing streetscape and the associated streetscape standards found in Article 33 may be modified if it can be determined by the Planning Department, in consultation with CDOT, that significant topographical constraints, unusual site-specific conditions related to the land, or significant utility constraints make such improvements infeasible. Significant utility constraints are limited to the presence of high voltage transmission structures.\n\n\n\n\nStreetscape Modifications for Tree PreservationThe Chief Urban Forester, in consultation with the CDOT Director, may modify the streetscape requirements and the associated streetscape standards found in Article 33 to accommodate the preservation of trees meeting acceptable standards for tree health, structural integrity, and risk level as determined by the Chief Urban Forester. If a modification to the location of the required sidewalk is necessary, then the location of the required sidewalk shall be prioritized in descending order as follows:\n\nSidewalk located between trees and building.\nSidewalk located between curb and trees, with substandard planting strip permitted.\nSidewalk located at the back of curb, with an additional foot of width added.Sidewalk widths may be modified to no less than five feet. On arterials with sidewalks located at back of curb, sidewalk widths may be modified to no less than six feet. Modification for sidewalk location or width shall be for the minimum length of sidewalk necessary to accommodate the preservation of trees meeting acceptable standards for tree health, structural integrity, and risk level as determined by the Chief Urban Forester.\n\n\nConstrained SpaceThe following constrained space standards shall be used where there is less than the required space for a complete streetscape between the face of an existing building that will not be replaced and the back of curb.\n\nWhere a sidewalk is required and there is ten feet or more between the face of the building and the back of curb, the available space shall be evenly divided between sidewalk and amenity zone/planting strip. When less than ten feet is available between the face of the building and the back of curb, see Table 32-3: Constrained Space Division When Sidewalk Required to determine use of space.\n\n\n\nWhere a shared-use path is required, the available space shall be evenly divided between a shared use path and amenity zone/planting strip. If, after evenly dividing the constrained space there is more than eight feet available allocated to the amenity zone/planting strip, then such extra space shall then be allocated to the shared-use path.\nWhen less than 16 feet is available between the face of the existing building that will not be replaced and the back of curb, see Table 32-4: Constrained Space Division When Shared-Use Path Required to determine use of space.\n\nIf the Chief Urban Forester determines that there is not adequate room for tree planting between the building and the curb after the required sidewalk or shared-use path area is deducted and if on-street parking is not provided, the sidewalk/shared-use path may extend across the full width of the area, or the remainder of the area shall be planted with grass or groundcover. Grass or groundcover shall not be used when less than two feet remain after the sidewalk area is deducted.\nIf the Chief Urban Forester determines that there is not adequate room for tree planting between the building and the curb after the required sidewalk or shared-use path area is deducted and if on-street parking is provided, the sidewalk/shared-use path shall extend across the full width of the area.\n", "metadataJson": "{\"section_url\": \"/articles/article-32-required-new-streets-transportation-improvements/#327-improvements-to-existing-streets\"}"}, {"title": "32.8 EXISTING UNIMPROVED RIGHTS-OF-WAY", "text": "Where residential development occurs on an existing lot of record abutting unimproved right-of-way, and that right-of\u00adway is the only access to the lot, the provisions below shall apply:A.
