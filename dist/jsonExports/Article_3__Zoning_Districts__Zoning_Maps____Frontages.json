The Zoning Map maintained by the Planning Department, and all the notations, references, and other information shown thereon are incorporated into, and made part of, this Ordinance.\nInterpretation of Zoning MapWhere uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the zoning districts shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall be used to interpret the Zoning Map:\n\nWhere the Zoning Map shows a boundary line located within a street or alley right-of-way, railroad, or utility line right-of-way, easement, navigable or non-navigable waterway, or other planimetric feature, it shall be considered to be in the center of the right-of-way, easement, waterway, or other planimetric feature. If the actual location of such right-of-way, easement, waterway, or planimetric feature varies slightly from the location as shown on the Zoning Map, then the actual location shall control.\nWhere a map shows a boundary line as being located a specific distance from a street or alley right-of-way, railroad or utility line right-of-way, easement, navigable or non-navigable waterway, or other planimetric feature, this distance shall control.\nWhere a map shows a zoning district boundary to approximately coincide with a property line or city, town, county or state border, the property line or city, town, county, or state border shall be the zoning district boundary, unless otherwise indicated.\nIn instances when an approved rezoning petition included detailed information regarding a boundary line, such information shall be used as the correct boundary line location.\nWhere detailed information regarding a boundary line is not available, and where a map shows a zoning district boundary to not coincide or approximately coincide with any street or alley right-of-way, railroad or utility line right\u00adof-way, easement, navigable or non-navigable waterway, other planimetric feature, or municipal border, and no dimensions are shown, the location of the boundary shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the map.\nIf, because of error or omission in the Zoning Map, any property within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance is not shown as being in a zoning district, a zoning district classification of N1-A shall be established for the property.\nIn instances where none of the above methods are sufficient to resolve the boundary location, the Zoning Administrator may interpret the reasonable maintenance of a regular boundary to establish the boundary location.\nInterpretation of information on the Zoning Map will be made by the Zoning Administrator. Appeals of the Zoning Administrator\u2019s interpretation may be made to the UDO Board of Adjustment. The Zoning Administrator will evaluate any alleged Zoning Map error using all available materials and records for the subject and adjacent properties. These materials include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nThe tax map, current or historic.\nLegal descriptions of properties or boundaries.\nHistorical zoning maps.\nApproved rezoning petition information.\nTax records, current or historic.\nZoning and special use permit case files.\nOfficial maps from other jurisdictions.\nTopographic and planimetric maps and aerial photos.\nOther documentable information from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\n\n\n\n\n", "metadataJson": "{\"section_url\": \"/articles/article-3-zoning-districts-zoning-maps-frontages/#34-official-zoning-map\"}"}, {"title": "3.5 APPLICABILITY OF FRONTAGES", "text": "Dimensional regulations, design regulations, and other aspects of the zoning districts within this Ordinance are frequently controlled by frontages.
