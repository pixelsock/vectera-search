Applicability and Exemptions\nApplicabilityThe green area requirements of this section shall apply to all development activity, including grading in anticipation of such development, within the corporate limits of the City and the City\u2019s extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ), whenever development would result in any of the following:\n\nNew construction of a principal structure.\nNew construction of a principal structure.\nApproval of a subdivision as defined by Article 30.3.A.\n\n\nExemptionsThe following are exempt from the requirements of this section as specified below:\n\nIncreases in built-upon area (BUA) or building coverage on lots where the existing principal structure is a single-family detached home, duplex, triplex or quadraplex.\nConstruction of a new single-family detached home, duplex, triplex, or quadraplex as a principal structure on a single lot, unless such construction is any of the following:\n\nPart of an approval of a new subdivision as defined by Section 30.3.A,\nConstructed on three or more contiguous/adjacent lots, or\nPart of a multi-dwelling development.\n\n\nPublic projects undertaken by public entities on public property, or public entities and owners of public property unless such projects do any of the following:\n\nIncrease building coverage.\nImpact existing trees required or protected by Section 20.14 through Section 20.17 or Chapter 21 of the City Code of Ordinances.Where public projects are exempt from this section, such projects shall be subject to interdepartmental or interagency agreements and land development standards pursuant to Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning Administration Manual.\n\n\n\n\nB. Standards by TierGreen area, perimeter planting and internal planting requirements are differentiated by Place Type as designated within the four tiers established within Table 20-4 below:C. Required Green Area15% or more of a development site that is subject to the applicability of this section shall be green area to be credited as provided for in Table 20-5 Green Area Credits.D. Green Area CreditsThe standards and methods for calculating required green area for sites shall be as follows:\nGreen area credits shall be used to achieve the required 15% green area pursuant to item B above. Green area credits are based on the corresponding multipliers for each credit and found in Table 20-5.\nThe process for calculating a property\u2019s green area credit shall be as follows:\n\nThe area of each green area credit is multiplied by its corresponding multiplier.\nThe resulting green area credits are added together.\nThe sum of these green area credits is then divided by the total land area of the development site to determine the green area percentage, which shall constitute at least 15% of the site per item B above.\n\n\nAll Green Area Credits shall comply with technical standards per Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning Administration Manual.\nGreen Area Method for CalculationSquare footage for existing and dedicated street rights-of-way, railroad rights-of-way and utility easements and for existing ponds and lakes shall be subtracted from the total site area before the required percent of the green area is calculated.\n1\u00a0In Tier 3 and Tier 4, as part of the required green area, the removal of existing trees may only be approved by the Chief Urban Forester pursuant to the Charlotte Tree Manual\u2019s Green Area Guideline when the tree and critical root zone are located within the buildable area where a City-required structure or improvement will be placed and there is no other reasonable location, and/or preservation would unreasonably restrict use of and/or access to the property. The area of existing trees removed shall be replanted with trees at 150% of the area removed at 36 trees per acre.2\u00a0Only permitted for residential development in N1-A, N1-B, N1-C, N1-D, and N1-E subject to the applicability of this section.3\u00a0Payment-in-Lieu and off-site mitigation may not be used in combination to meet the requirements of this section.4\u00a0Intermittent and perennial streams within the project boundary shall be delineated by a certified professional using U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and N.C.

Tree Save StandardsThe following standards shall apply to all tree save areas within the required green area.\nTree save areas shall be free of invasive plant species unless otherwise approved by the Chief Urban Forester. If an area proposed for tree save contains invasive plant species at the time of such proposal, such invasive plant species shall be removed prior to final plat approval for subdivisions. If there is no final plat for a project, the invasive plant species shall be removed prior to the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy. Invasive plant species are considered removed if they are no longer living in or under the tree canopy. Property owners are required to maintain this condition for compliance with this section.\nPursuant to Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning Administration Manual, any alterations to the tree save area in Tier 3 and Tier 4 Place Types shall be accomplished without mechanized tools and vehicular equipment and made of organic, environmentally friendly materials, unless otherwise approved by the Chief Urban Forester. For sites located in Tier 1 or Tier 2 Place Types, alterations to the tree save area do not have to meet the above standard. However, if alterations are made or amenities are added, these changes shall be made in a manner that is not detrimental to the saved trees or their critical root zone. Alterations and addition of any amenities shall be approved by the Chief Urban Forester.\nAny tree save area less than 30 feet in width shall be delineated on site with boundary and property lines by a licensed surveyor prior to the first submittal of plans.\nNo structure shall be allowed within ten feet of the tree save area. A building restriction note shall be indicated on the record plat pursuant to Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning Administration Manual. For sites located in Tier 1 or Tier 2 Place Types, the ten foot building restriction may be counted toward the tree save area requirement as long as this area continuously and directly abuts a tree save area and remains pervious. However, regulatory trees may not be planted within this ten foot building restriction area.\nAdditional amenity elements including, but not limited to, benches, trails, gazebos, sheds, fences, may be permitted by the Chief Urban Forester pursuant to Section 4.1 of the UDO Zoning Administration Manual.\nTree save areas may include areas dedicated to Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation for greenways or parks or the City of Charlotte for the Tree Canopy Preservation Program, Urban Arboretum Trail, or other City trail projects.
