Special Purpose & Overlay Zoning Districts", "metadataJson": "{\"base_url\": \"article-14-special-purpose-overlay-zoning-districts\"}", "section": [{"title": "14.1 HDO HISTORIC DISTRICT OVERLAY", "text": "A. PurposeThe purpose of the HDO Historic District Overlay is to establish local historic districts to encourage the restoration, preservation, rehabilitation, and conservation of historically, architecturally, and archaeologically significant areas, structures, buildings, sites, and objects and their surroundings from potentially adverse influences which may cause the decline, decay, or total destruction of important historical, architectural, and archaeological features, which are a part of the City\u2019s heritage, and to review new construction design to ensure compatibility with the character of the district.B. ApplicabilityThe HDO Historic District Overlay is applied as an overlay zoning district which will supersede other zoning districts with respect to compatibility, context, and appropriateness of exterior features as described in item E below within a designated local historic district. An HDO Historic District Overlay cannot be applied in combination with any of the following: HDO-S Streetside Historic District Overlay, NCO Neighborhood Character Overlay, and RIO Residential Infill Overlay.C. Designation\nHistoric District Overlays shall consist of areas that are deemed to be of special significance in terms of their history, architecture and/or culture and to possess integrity of design, setting, materials, feeling and association. The area, buildings, structures, sites, or objects shall be significant elements of the cultural, social, economic, political, or architectural history of the City or of the archaeological history or prehistory of the City and the conservation of such a district will provide for the education, pleasure, and enhancement of the quality of life of all residents of the City.\nThe Historic District Commission (HDC) shall make an investigation and report on the historical, architectural, or archaeological significance of the buildings, structures, features, sites, objects, or surroundings included in a proposed district, and prepare a description of the boundaries of the district.\nThe North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, or an agent or employee designated by its Secretary, shall make an analysis of, and recommendations concerning, this report and description of proposed boundaries in accordance with state law. Failure of the Department to submit its written analysis and recommendations to the City Council within 30 calendar days after a written request for such analysis has been mailed to the Department shall relieve the City of any responsibility for awaiting such an analysis, and the City Council may at any time thereafter take any necessary action.\nWith respect to any changes in the boundaries of such district subsequent to its initial establishment or the creation of additional districts within the City, the investigative studies and reports shall be prepared by the Historic District Commission. Changes in the boundaries of an initial district or proposals for additional districts shall also be submitted to the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources in accordance with the provisions stated above.\nThe City Council shall designate the boundaries of a new HDO or change in boundary to an HDO in accordance with procedures set forth in Section 37.2 for amending the Zoning Map.\nD. Certificate of Appropriateness Required\nNo exterior portion of any building or other structure, including masonry walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and pavement, or other appurtenant features, above-ground utility structures, any type of outdoor advertising sign, or important landscape and natural features may be erected, altered, restored, moved, or demolished within an HDO until after the property owner, or his/her designated agent, has contacted the Historic District Commission staff to determine whether the project will require a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA).\nWhen a Certificate of Appropriateness is required, an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be submitted and work may not begin until the Certificate of Appropriateness has been issued. A Certificate of Appropriateness shall be issued by the Historic District Commission prior to the issuance of a building permit or other permit granted, for the purposes of constructing, altering, moving, or demolishing structures. A Certificate of Appropriateness is required whether or not a building permit is required.\nE. Exterior FeaturesExterior features include the architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of the exterior of a building or other structure, including the kind and texture of the building materials, the size and scale of the building, and the type and style of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs, and other appurtenant fixtures. In the case of outdoor advertising signs, exterior features mean the style, material, size, and location of all such signs. Exterior features may also include color and important landscape and natural features of the area.F. Minor WorksThe Historic District Commission has the authority to delegate to their professional staff approval of certain types of minor works consistent with the detailed standards approved by the Historic District Commission. Minor works do not involve substantial alterations, additions, or removals that could impair the integrity of the property and/or the district as a whole or would be incongruous with the special character of the district. Staff shall not deny a request for a Certificate of Appropriateness. All applications where it cannot be determined that the action is a minor work or where the application may be incongruous with the special character of the district shall be submitted to the Historic District Commission.G. Interior ArrangementThe Historic District Commission has no jurisdiction over interior spaces, unless the arrangement of interior features directly affects the integrity of the exterior of the property and, therefore, would be incongruous with the special character of the district as a whole.H. Ordinary Maintenance and Emergency RepairNothing in these provisions shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance, repair, or removal of any exterior feature in a historic district which does not involve a change in design, material, or outer appearance nor to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or demolition of any such feature that a Building Inspector or similar official shall certify is required for public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. In the event of an emergency, Historic District Commission staff may authorize the immediate restoration of any exterior feature to pre-disaster conditions. Historic District Commission staff shall be consulted and/or the feature shall be well documented photographically and such documentation shall be made available to the Historic District Commission for its files, if appropriate.I. Restoration or Repair of Historic FeaturesThe Zoning Administrator in consultation with the Historic District Commission Administrator may administratively approve the restoration or replacement of an historic feature necessitated in the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties as defined by the National Park Service (Secretary\u2019s Standards) if the feature would encroach into a required setback or required landscape yard that is not permitted by this Ordinance. Restoration or replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.J. Demolition or Removal\nAfter the designation of a historic district, no building or structure located in that district shall be demolished or otherwise removed until the owner of the property has applied for a Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition or removal. If the Historic District Commission determines that the property does not have special significance and value toward maintaining the character of the historic district because of age, architectural style, associative history, designation as a local historic landmark, listed as a contributing building in the National Register of Historic Places, or structural condition, the Historic District Commission may grant a Certificate of Appropriateness for the immediate demolition or removal of the property.\nIf the property is determined by the Historic District Commission to have special significance and value toward maintaining the character of the district, the Historic District Commission may delay demolition or removal for no more than 365 days from the date of the approval. During this 365 day period, the Historic District Commission may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building.\nAn application for a Certificate of Appropriateness authorizing the demolition of a building, structure, or site within the district may not be denied. The maximum period of delay authorized by this section shall be reduced by the Historic District Commission where it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or return from such property by virtue of the delay. If the Historic District Commission finds that the building has no particular significance or value toward maintaining the character of the district, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal.\nIf the Commission has voted to recommend designation of an area as an Historic District and final designation has not been made by City Council, the demolition or destruction of any building, site, or structure located in the proposed district may be delayed by the HDC for a period of up to 180 days or until City Council takes final action on the designation, whichever occurs first. Should City Council approve the designation prior to the expiration of the 180 day delay period, an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition shall then be filed. The maximum period of delay for a Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition shall be reduced by the HDC by the period of delay while the designation was pending.\nK. Compliance with Other Applicable LawsIf site plans have been submitted that are not in compliance with this Ordinance or other identified state or local laws, then the Certificate of Appropriateness or any permits or certificates issued by the City may be revoked. An applicant shall submit site plans that are in compliance with this Ordinance and with any other state or local laws designated by the Historic District Commission. If the Historic District Commission staff or the Historic District Commission determines that submitted site plans are not in compliance with this Ordinance or other state or local laws designated by the Historic District Commission, then the Historic District Commission staff or Historic District Commission shall not be required to proceed to review the application for the Certificate of Appropriateness until site plans have been submitted that are in accordance with this Ordinance and applicable state or local laws. If site plans have been submitted that are not in compliance with this Ordinance or other identified state or local laws, then the Certificate of Appropriateness or any permits or certificates issued by the City may be revoked.L.

(Hereinafter: Secretary\u2019s Standards), and the Historic District Design Standards adopted by the Historic District Commission. Approval of a Certificate of Appropriateness by the Historic District Commission should not be interpreted as approval for any other process, such as state or federal tax incentives.\n\n\nApplicationThe applicant has the responsibility to submit an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness that is accurate, complete, and accompanied by sufficient information to fully depict the proposed development, alteration, rehabilitation, relocation, restoration, or demolition. A fee, as applicable, shall be provided to the Historic District Commission staff. If the applicant fails to submit a complete application and any required fee, then the application shall not be submitted for review to the Historic District Commission until the deficient requirements have been met to the satisfaction of the Historic District Commission staff.\nSubmission of Site Plan ComplianceAn applicant shall submit site plans that are in compliance with this Ordinance and with any other local or State laws designated by the Historic District Commission. If the Historic District Commission staff or the Historic District Commission determines that submitted site plans are not in compliance with this Ordinance or other State or local laws designated by the Historic District Commission, then the Historic District Commission staff or Historic District Commission shall not be required to proceed to review the application for the Certificate of Appropriateness until site plans have been submitted that are in accordance with this Ordinance and applicable state or local laws.\nEvidentiary Hearing NoticeThe Historic District Commission staff shall follow the requirements for evidentiary hearing notice in Section 37.8.A.9 to inform the applicant, property owner if different from the applicant, and abutting property owners prior to the hearing.\nProcedure\n\nPrior to Evidentiary Hearing\n\nAll properly filed applications for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be reviewed and acted upon within a reasonable time, not to exceed 180 days from the date the application is filed.
