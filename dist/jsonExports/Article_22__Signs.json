Calculation of Sign Area\nThe sign area includes the area within a single, continuous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of characters, lettering, logos, illustration, or ornamentations, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the display or differentiating the sign from the background to which it is placed. Structural supports with no sign copy shall not be included in the sign area. If a sign is attached to an entrance wall or fence, only that portion of that wall or fence onto which the sign face or letters are placed shall be calculated in the sign area.\nMEASUREMENT OF SIGN AREA\nFor calculating maximum area of window signs, the window area is calculated as a continuous surface until divided by an architectural or structural element. Mullions are not considered an element that divides window area. The area of a window sign is calculated by the same method as for other sign areas, per Item 1 above. The standards below further apply to the calculation of window sign areas.\n\nShadowbox design within display windows, where the window display is designed with a background enclosure within two feet of the window against which signs are mounted that block views into the establishment, is considered a window sign and the entire area of the shadowbox is subject to the maximum sign area limitation.\nPerforated window graphics/window clings, which show an image to the outside but allow those on the interior to view outside, are not considered transparent and the entirety of the graphic is counted as a window sign.\n\n\nMEASUREMENT OF WINDOW SIGN AREAB. Measurement of Sign HeightSign height is measured from the base of the sign at the ground to the highest point of the sign, including any attachments.MEASUREMENT OF SIGN HEIGHTC. Measurement of Vertical ClearanceFor building-mounted signs, vertical clearance is measured as the vertical distance measured from the ground directly below the sign to the lowest point of the sign.MEASUREMENT OF VERTICAL CLEARANCED. Determination of Number of Sign FacesSigns are considered double-faced if the faces are positioned relative to one another at an internal angle not exceeding 45 degrees. The sign area for a double-faced sign is calculated as the measurement of one sign face. If the internal angle exceeds 45 degrees, sign area is calculated as the sum of both faces. This applies to all signs except those located on corner lots, in which case the internal angle for a double-faced sign may not exceed 90 degrees. In all cases, this measurement refers to the internal angle of sign faces on a single structure.MEASUREMENT OF SIGN FACES (ANGLED SIGN) \u2013 CORNER LOT\u200dMEASUREMENT OF SIGN FACES (ANGLED SIGN) \u2013 INTERIOR LOTE.

Landmark and Historic Signs\nDesignation Procedure\n\nThe property owner of the parcel where a proposed landmark sign is located, or the owner of the site where a proposed historic sign is to be relocated, may apply for designation of an existing sign as a landmark or historic sign. Such application shall be submitted on a form determined by the Planning Department. The Zoning Administrator has the authority to approve or to disapprove the designation of landmark or historic signs based upon the criteria stated below. At the time of the filing of a landmark or historic sign designation application, the applicant shall file all necessary information for the Planning Department to determine if the sign meets the criteria for the requested designation. The Zoning Administrator has the authority to request whatever other information is necessary to make a decision. The burden of proof for meeting the criteria is upon the applicant.\nIn approving or disapproving a landmark or historic sign application, the Zoning Administrator shall state the reasons in writing. An appeal of the decision to the UDO Board of Adjustment shall be properly filed within 30 days of the date of the decision as shown on the face of the decision.\nOnce a sign has been designated as a landmark or historic sign, the Planning Department shall then issue a certificate to the applicant stating that the sign has been duly designated as a landmark or historic sign.\nIf the sign being considered for landmark or historic designation is associated with a designated local landmark or located in an established Historic District, the Planning Department shall receive a recommendation from the appropriate Charlotte-Mecklenburg Historic Landmark Commission or the Historic District Commission before deciding.\nAfter a sign is designated as a landmark or historic sign it shall be maintained in its original condition, shape, and size, except for minor changes required for structural enhancements or changes required to comply with minimum Building or Electrical Codes, or to remove portions from a public right-of-way. Where original materials are unavailable, substitute materials shall be used that are as similar as possible to the original material.\nWhile a designated landmark or historic sign is deemed conforming, this section is not intended to prevent the Planning Department from enforcing this Ordinance if it, or another City agency, determines that there is a violation of any provisions, or the intent and purposes of any provisions of this Ordinance.\nNothing in this section shall prohibit the owner(s) of a designated landmark or historic sign from removing such a sign.\n\n\nLandmark SignsThe purpose of designating a sign as a landmark sign is to encourage the restoration and retention of on-premise, nonconforming signs that are historically significant. Once designated as a landmark sign, the sign is deemed conforming.\n\nDesignation CriteriaThe Planning Department may designate an existing on-premises sign as a landmark sign if it meets the following criteria:\n\nThe sign has been in continuous existence at the present location for at least 25 years.\nThe sign is an on-premises sign, which meets at least four of the following criteria:\n\nIt was expressly designed for the business, institution, or other establishments at that location.\nIt bears a national or local emblem, logo, or other graphic that is unique to the property or the establishment.\nThe sign exhibits unique or rare characteristics that enhance the streetscape or identity of a neighborhood.\nThe sign is significant as evidence of the history of the product, business, or service advertised.\nThe sign is characteristic of a specific historic period.\nThe sign is integral to the building\u2019s design or physical fabric.\nThe sign represents an outstanding example of the sign maker\u2019s art due to craftsmanship, use of materials, or design.\n\n\nThe sign complies with the appropriate provisions of the North Carolina State Building and Electrical Codes. Such signs are allowed structural and electrical repairs, with the approval of a sign permit, to meet the standards of such codes.\nIf any portion of the sign is permitted to remain in or over a City right-of-way, a CDOT encroachment agreement is required.\nThe sign is structurally safe or is capable of being made so without substantially altering its historical significance.\n\n\nLocationIf a designated landmark sign is moved on-premise, it shall be subject to the location standards of this article.\n\n\nHistoric SignsThe restoration and retention of nonconforming, historically significant signs that have been removed from their original locations and are to be reused is encouraged. Allowing those signs to move to other locations within the community is necessary to ensure preservation. Once designated as a historic sign, the sign is deemed conforming.\n\nDesignation CriteriaThe Planning Department may designate an existing sign as a historic sign if it meets the following criteria:\n\nThe sign shall be at least 25 years old.\nThe sign shall meet at least three of the following criteria:\n\nIt bears a national or local emblem, logo, or other graphic that is unique to the community.\nThe sign exhibits unique or rare characteristics that enhance the streetscape or identity of a neighborhood.\nThe sign is significant as evidence of the history of the product, business, or service advertised.\nThe sign is characteristic of a specific historic period.\nThe sign represents an outstanding example of the sign maker\u2019s art due to craftsmanship, use of materials, or design.\nThe sign complies with the appropriate provisions of the North Carolina State Building and Electrical Codes. Such signs are allowed structural and electrical repairs, with the approval of a sign permit, to meet the standards of such codes.\nThe sign is structurally safe or is capable of being made so without substantially altering its historical significance.\n\n\n\n\nLocationThe sign may be moved to another location on the site where it is currently located or to another property. It is encouraged that the sign be relocated to a site within the neighborhood from which it originated. The receiving site shall be located outside of a Neighborhood 1 Zoning District or Neighborhood 2 Zoning District for commercial signs.\nNonconforming Aspects of Relocated Signs\n\nRelocated historic signs that are nonconforming based on their size, height, or lighting do not have to be brought into conformance. However, such signs shall not increase the degree of nonconformity by any physical alterations to the sign that previously rendered them nonconforming.\nSign lighting of relocated historic signs shall be located, screened, or shielded so that abutting lots located in any Neighborhood 1 Place Type and Neighborhood 2 Place Type are not directly illuminated and do not cause glare or impair the vision of motorists.\nProjecting signs that extend beyond the maximum projecting dimension based upon the existing dimension of the sign require a CDOT encroachment agreement if they project into the city right-of-way.\nThe relocation of historic signs that are considered prohibited by this article may maintain the prohibited characteristic, provided such features are considered part of the historic or cultural character of the sign and approved as part of the designation.\nRelocated outdoor advertising signs shall comply with only the following sections of Table 22-6: zoning district, location, spacing, and tree-cutting regulations.\n\n\n\n\n", "metadataJson": "{\"section_url\": \"/articles/article-22-signs/#2211-\\u00a0-special-sign-regulations\"}"}, {"title": "22.12 \u00a0 PROHIBITED SIGNS", "text": "The following signs and sign structures are specifically prohibited.
